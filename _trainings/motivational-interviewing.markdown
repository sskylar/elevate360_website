Motivational Interviewing is a brief intervention designed to mobilize a patient’s internal resources for change by enhancing intrinsic motivation. It aims to reduce ambivalence about a significant change, increase self-efficacy to make the change, and thereby, increase the commitment to make the change. MI is both a set of techniques as well as a style or way of being with a patient, which helps them to resolve ambivalence and find within themselves the resources for change. MI is a great resource for the clinician working with patients seeking to make behavior changes.

MI trainings can be tailored to clinician skill level, patient population, location, and length of training desired. Each training incorporates didactic instruction, video demonstration, case-based instruction, and role-plays with feedback. Each trainee is given a folder with all training materials and will receive, at the end of training, a Certificate of Completion.
