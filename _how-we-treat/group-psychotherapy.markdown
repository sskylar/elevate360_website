Group psychotherapy is a powerful therapeutic tool that can help people develop the skills needed to change negative thought patterns and cognitions.  Working through issues by participating in a group setting can reduce feelings of isolation, increase optimism, and is particularly useful in helping people learn new ways of coping with interpersonal and relationship challenges.

Elevate360 offers many different therapy groups, some are skills based, some utilize cognitive behavioral techniques to help identify and challenge problematic thought patterns, and some provide support and structure for living a balanced life.  Groups occur weekly, are from 60-90 minutes, and include up to 8 members.  Each group is led by a psychologist who guides the discussion and ensures that all members are respectful and supportive of one another. Group members are actively encouraged to provide support and feedback to one another.
